          <p class="lh-copy f4">I am very passionate about coffee. In my spare time I tinker around my kitchen,
            trying
            to
            craft the best tasting French press, espresso or other various pourovers. I read about different sorts of
            beans and their sources, about ratio methods and ways to make the cup of Joe taste better.</p>
          <img class="section" src="./photos/brewculator/coffee-standartma.jpeg">
          <p class="lh-copy f4">
            Having spent more
            than a year exploring the world of coffee I noticed a repeating pattern - while brewing, I had to
            double-check the specific ratios, then find a calculator, then find a timer and after all that's set up I
            actually focus on the craft of making a cup. All of these complications started to bother me and did impact
            the quality of my coffee at times. At that moment the idea was born - I should make myself a calculator that
            has a bunch of pre-made ratios for the most popular brewing methods, fine control over the measuring units
            and probably some general tips of the brewing method itself.

          <p class="lh-copy f4">When working on the side, I usually have the tendency to get carried away, hence why I
            follow a
            design process structure strictly. I always start with a bit of research that helps me formulate my idea,
            then I open up my trusty notebook for some of that hand drawing ideation. Once I get something cooking, I go
            to Sketch and I aim to formulate an initial design that I usually build upon until I'm happy with it. After
            the design is finalised, I try to bring it to life either on the web or on my iPhone.</p>

          <h3 class="f3-ns f3">Research and wireframing</h3>
          <p class="lh-copy f4">
            The world of coffee is vast, rich and very complicated. The digitalisation of it has commenced more than 20
            years ago. It's current state spans from various coffee forums and websites to mobile apps of all sorts and
            desktop-based applications for coffee gene analysis and tracking. The main idea of my research was to see if
            there's a need of an application like the one I had in mind. While the idea of a coffee calculator was
            present on the web and mobile realms, the exact combination of having your brewing recipes, methods and
            ratios in one place in your pocket were either behind paywalls or scattered throughout multiple pages and
            apps.
          </p>
          <img class="section" src="./photos/brewculator/brewculator-sketchbook-wireframe.png">
          <p class="lh-copy f4">
            The research confirmed that there's a gap which I could potentially fill and hopefully make the mornings
            of other coffee enthusiasts a tad easier with my app. The idea for a coffee calculator has been in my head
            for the past one year, and I even had something very basic done for Caffetarium - the coffee blog I've been
            working on. I was very close to leverage both the design and approach to what I had before but then I
            encountered an awesome tweet.

          <i></i>
          <p class="lh-copy f4">A major part of the inspiration of how the app would work came from the super-talanted
            designer Aris Acoba
            and his tiny <a href="https://twitter.com/aris_acoba/status/1303641016432377857">ice-pour over
              calculator</a> he crafted a while back.</p>

          <p class="lh-copy f4">
            Thanks to the combination of what I had in mind, Aris' approach and my interpretation of it, it was time to
            boot up Sketch and bring this thing to life.

          <img class="section" src="./photos/brewculator/brewculator-twophones-left.png">
          <p class="lh-copy f4">
            After a number of iterations, small tweaks and good amount of reading of Apple's HIG, I ended up with the
            first version of the home screen. It's core idea is simplicity and flexibility at the hands of the users. My
            idea was to keep it as simple as possible, giving the users the ability to quickly calculate their coffee to
            water ratio and then focus on their brew in real life.

          <h4 class="pt3 f3-ns f4">Filtering Segments</h4>
          <img class="section" src="./photos/brewculator/brewculator-mockup-filtering-pills.png">
          <p class="lh-copy f4">
            The screen is stripped down to a simple pill selector, the calculator itself and a hidden
            section with additional tips for the specific recipe.

            The selected recipe is highlighted both with the pill and the screen's heading as well. This is the most
            important controller in the app, since coffee is a very delicate science, in which you can ruin a cup with
            just a couple of grams of extra beans or water. Knowing that, having the different ratios as the first
            prominent item is crucial.

            The predefined ratio are based on a research I did, exploring the most popular recipes from renowned
            baristas and coffee experts from around the world.

          <h4 class="pt3 f3-ns f4">The Ratio Calculator</h4>
          <img class="section" src="./photos/brewculator/brewculator-calculator.png">
          <p class="lh-copy f4">
            The calculator is the core of the app. It was especially important for me to focus and create a seamless,
            minimalistic UI so it is intuitive and easy to use. This section of the app is split in two input fields
            which interact with one another based on the selected recipe. For example if you input 30 grams of coffee on
            the top field, the app would automatically return the needed amount of water (510ml in that case) for your
            recipe.

              class="b">Coffee</span> and <span class="b">Water</span> sections of the calculator</p>
          <p class="lh-copy f4">
            At the bottom of both input fields, I added a bunch of segmented controls which allow the users change the
            measuring units of their choice. While my personal preference is to use grams for all my brews, many people
            are still using imperial metrics. The cool part of this feature is that it will allow users to have the
            flexibility to calculate their brews however they feel most comfortable, having a vast number of
            measurements at their hand.

          <p class="lh-copy f4">
            The final section of the screen is where the additional information for the brew would be listed. It's
            function is as a reminder of the general expectations of for the corresponding brewing method. The case is
            that many of us coffee enthusiasts are making our coffees following various methods which are fairly
            different one from another, and each has specifics that we tend to forget.

          <p class="lh-copy f4">
            The idea of the onboarding process came when I was reminded that a good portion of the world is using
            imperial measuring units and how it wouldn't be most convenient if I create an app that's solely based on
            what I'm used to, rather than what's useful for all.
            In it's simple process, the user is being taken through two very important steps.
            The first one is where they're able to chose their preferred brewing method and set up their default
            calculator ratios for ease of use. The second step allows the users to either select their measuring units
            of choise or stay with the default ones. Once that's complete, the user is being taken to the main screen
            with their pre-selected brewing method and calibrated units of choice.

          <p class="lh-copy f4">
            With the initial design in place and the defined updates for further releases, I embarked on the journey of
            developing my first app in SwiftUI.
            In the prototype above, you're able to see how I get the input data from the user with a simple get-set
            method. I get the initial input value regardless of the field, then calculate following the selected ratio
            from the onboarding process, and set the result as value to the other field. While the prototype seems
            clunky, it felt like a big win to be able to program the calculation methodology.

            My goal is to structure a public product roadmap, and hopefully release a functioning app to the App Store
            by the end of 2021. With that said, it has been a pleasent, challenging experience so far. Stay tuned and

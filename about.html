          <p class="f5 f3-m f3-l">
            I was born in Sofia, Bulgaria - an interesting city, in an interesting country being a part of a very
            <i>specific</i> region of Europe. I was lucky enough to have an adventure-filled childhood full of bike
            rides, tree climbing, comic book drawing and being genuinely mischievous.
            In my teens, I was extraordinarily good at Call of Duty, was listening to angsty music, had greesy long hair
            and I discovered the world of design. I cut the hair, cut the angsty music, yet did not cut my passion for
            design. Hence why I'm still pushing pixels with love and passion.

          </p>
          <p class="f5 f3-m f3-l">Today, I'm living with my best friend, which happens to be my <span
              class="strike gray">fiancee</span> <span class="b">wife</span> as well. We're surrounded by our 75 plants
            and
            in our household, I'm the one responsible for brewing our coffee and taking the film photos. In my spare
            time, I aim to spend more time in nature. Either I hike, walk around in the local forests or shred some
            trails with my mountain bike, I thoroughly enjoy the smell of pines and leaves around me. When I'm at home,
            I usually lift weights, read, write and really focus on the craft of coffee brewing.</p>

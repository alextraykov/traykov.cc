          <h2 class="f2 f1-m f1-l">About me</h2>
       
          <p class="f5 f3-m f3-l pb3">
            Greetings, friend! I'm Alexander, a dedicated full-time father, husband, and designer.
          </p>

          <img class="br5 pb3" src="./photos/about-photos/me-alpes.png">
          <p class="f5 f3-m f3-l pb3">
            My design journey began at 17, sparked by an opportunity from my graphic design teacher. Crafting a successful poster for the Sofia Philharmonic Orchestra ignited a passion that resonated deeply within me. Since that pivotal moment, I felt as design has been my calling, and I've embraced it since.
          </p>
          <p class="f5 f3-m f3-l pb3">
            Fast forward 11 years, and I find myself thriving as a UX Team Lead at Quickbase, delving into the dynamic realms of leadership and management. Reflecting on my journey, I've always gravitated towards leadership, finding immense fulfillment in aiding the growth of others while evolving alongside them.
          </p>
          <p class="f5 f3-m f3-l pb3">
            Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm an extroverted, occasionally long-winded dude with a profound interest in philosophy, psychology, coffee, and physical training. 
          </p>
          </p>
          <p class="f5 f3-m f3-l pb3">
            In the realm of personal life, I proudly wear the badge of "dad" to Sofia, a delightful little rascal that became the primary reason for me to exist. Sofia's presence is a testament to the love I share with my equally remarkable wife, the cornerstone of my world. In essence, my family is the heartbeat of my existence, influencing almost every action, inaction and decision I take.

          <h2>How it all started</h2>
          <p>
            We are blog started as a quick CSS exercise of mine and grew to a growing platform, which aims to put the
            spotlight of world design on hardworking, humble and successful creatives around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea behind the design was that I wanted to give back to my local Bulgarian community. I tried to
            interview a mixture of worldwide designers and creatives from Bulgaria, to create a place where inspiration
            and experiences were being shared.
          </p>

        <div class="section">
          <p class="f3 b">Figuring out the right qustions</p>
          <p>
            This was the most challenging task in the whole creation process of we-are. The questions were the
            foundation
            of the entire blog. They set the tone and the complete feel of the website. My idea was to make the
            interviews both insightful and personal. This is why I decided to keep questions like <span class="b">"When
              did you find your passion for X?"</span> or <span class="b">"Describe the beginning of your day"</span>
            â€“ it's
            because through questions like this
            you get a
            more personal feeling towards the interviewed person.

          <p class="f3 b">Developing the interview process</p>
          <p>From the beginning, I was fully aware that interviews of this sort are going to be based mainly on
            kindness
            and compassion. We-are is this young, small locus of creatives giving insights over their lives both as
            humans and as professionals. It's driven by the acts of the interviewees, by their openness and kindness.</p>
          <p>
            With that thought in my head, I wanted to focus that there is no pressure around the interviews. None. I'll
            send you over the Dropbox Paper document, and you could take all the time on the world. If you don't feel
            like writing it down - don't do it, it's perfectly fine. No pressure. No judgement.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the beginning, the Dropbox Paper document looked something like this.
            It was my fault for not giving myself some time to reflect and discover that this pre-filled document feels
            entirely soulless.
          </p>

        </div class="section">
        <div class="section">
          <p>
            I tried to add more structure to the document, so I used the new placeholder option that Dropbox Paper
            introduced. Rather than leaving the input field sections with a generic description text, I aimed to make
            it
            more playful and personal through some tiny tweaks in the input copy. For example the input field for the
            question <span class="b">"When did you find your passion for X?"</span> is <span class="b">"What was the
              first step towards your astonishing career?"</span> â€“ with this, I'm trying to make the interviewer feel
            appreciated and cared for â€“ which is
            the actual
            truth.

            Before you close this document, I want to thank you with all my heart for taking the time out and
            supporting
            the cause of this tiny blog. It really means a lot to me, and it surely does matter a lot for the further
            development of our creative community.

          <p>
            With that playful yet personal copy, I'm trying to convey the feeling of togetherness and empathy through
            words for the interviewed.

          <p>
            I've always had a thing for clean, functional design. I've been struggling with keeping up with trends
            because I didn't find them attractive. From the skeuomorphic designs to the pastel flat UI's, to the
            gradient-heavy apps I've always known that a light background, a beautiful Swiss font and a right amount of
            whitespace almost always do the work. This is why I decided to challenge myself â€“ I tried to create a merge
            of brutalism and order. To contain the "chaos" in a grid, with set spacings, colours and type scales.
          </p>

            And this is how I came up with the Instagram posts, through which I was going to promote the interviews.
            What
            were the most critical parts of the post? The name of the interviewed creative, a photo of them and their
            title.

            Currently, we-are stands strong with around unique 200 users visiting the website monthly. While there is a
            significant drop of users, due to the inactivity of the blog in the past 4 to 5 months. I'm planning on
            growing the blog, and hopefully, after the first half of this year, I'll be able to release the We-are
            podcast & we-are newsletter.

            We-are is a project of mine, which challenges me till this very day. Its whole idea is built on top of the
            mutual dedication and kindness between all the interviewers and the idea behind this blog. While increasing
            the traffic, or generating some revenue is something I'd love to happen, that doesn't stray me away from my
            primary goal of this blog â€“ developing a place where designers from around the world share their
            experiences.

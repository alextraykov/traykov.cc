                    <p>
                        I consider my grandfather as one of the wisest people I've met. He's been on this Earth for
                        more than 86 years, lived through World War II, the Cold War, held the title of Deputy
                        Minister, witnessed rise and fall of the Soviet Regime and its horrors. Simply put, grandpa has
                        seen and lived through shit, that not a lot of people have. He's been like a father figure of
                        mine, showing me that everything is achievable with discipline, persistence, and respect
                        towards people. Following his behaviour, I learned the meaning of humbleness, compassion, and
                        kindness, yet there one thing that I'll be forever grateful for ‚Äì he thought me <span class="b">compersion.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="bl i pl4">Compersion ‚Äì From French comp√©rage, derived from French comp√®re, from Old
                        French
                        comper, from
                        Latin compater, compatrem (‚Äúgodfather‚Äù). Compersion is the feeling of joy one has experiencing
                        another's joy, such as in witnessing a toddler's joy and feeling joy in response.
                        Grandpa has this unique trait to get genuinely happy when he witnessed the joy of others. He
                        felt delighted not only for his close ones but for most of the people he knew, and I've always
                        looked up to this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One day I asked him ‚Äì </br>
                        <span class="i">"Grandpa, how come when someone else feels happy, you get happy too?"</span>
                        His reply has been a mantra for me since the first time I heard it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bl i pl4 f3">
                        If you want to live a content, fulfilling and joyful life ‚Äì be happy not only for yourself but
                        for others. If you're going to poison your life and the life of others slowly ‚Äì be envious.
                        There is nothing that's more self-destructive than it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This sentence he told me stuck in my mind and it has been my guide when the feeling of jealousy
                        arose. Thanks to his example, in time, I was able to shake off that toxic feeling entirely, yet
                        I see many people ‚Äì both close friends, family and acquaintances struggle with jealousy on a
                        daily basis.
                    </p>
                    <h2>How we're living in the age of comparison-based relationships</h2>
                    <p>
                        We're living in the age of the most rapid technological advancement known to humans. In our
                        known history, there has never been a time where people connected with each other with such
                        ease. Thanks to the internet, we're having the ability to break the physical boundaries of
                        distance allowing us to consume all sorts of information, both meaningful and senseless. We've
                        all been there ‚Äì watching the 12th "Dank meme compilation" on YouTube or scrolling through
                        Instagram and Facebook, wasting hours, while we could spend our neural power on reading books,
                        learning a new language, drawing, playing an instrument, meditating of just taking a walk. But
                        learning a language takes time, and we can't get all that tasty dopamine in just five minutes ‚Äì
                        on the contrary, just a couple of likes on your new portrait photo of our pizza feeds our brain
                        with a micro-dose of that tasty hormone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now don't get me wrong, from my experience, social media is cool. It gives me the opportunity
                        to reach out to people I like and to have an easy, ongoing digital communication, ignoring most
                        of the physical boundaries like distance, sound dispersion or the fact that in order to have a
                        proper vocal discussion, most of the time human beings have to be at the same location.
                        While the lack of borders is great, social media has some bad in it as well, isn't that true?
                        Nowadays we're experiencing something never seen before ‚Äì we're allowed to take a glimpse at
                        handpicked moments of the lives of our acquaintances through various social media channels, and
                        if you're not lucky enough, to be though from a very young age that comparing yourself to
                        others is pointless ‚Äì you're heading towards one hell of a ride.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You have probably experienced this scenario ‚Äì you're sitting on the couch, tired after work,
                        tapping through our Instagram stories. What is the usual content you see ‚Äì smiling faces of
                        known and unknown people, having fun on beaches and mountain resorts, eating local cuisine or
                        just being in love, diving in the joys of life? Some days we feel fine, and content like this
                        could even bring a smile on our faces, but as we know we all have our bad days. </p>
                    <p>
                        Days where we feel lonely, sad, angry or ignored ‚Äì the days where our weakened emotional state
                        leads us, unintentionally, to compare our "miserable existence" with the "amazing lives" of
                        others
                        Usually, at moments like this one of our biggest enemies creeps in ‚Äì self-pity. I've looked at
                        self-pity as the Head of Espionage of one's negative emotions. Gloominess blurs our minds,
                        covering up the fact that kindness and compassion are innate human feelings, and it leads us on
                        the path of toxic comparison.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My definition of toxic comparison is comparison based on your current emotional state,
                        primarily fed by self-pity, rather than common sense and logic. A good example of toxic
                        comparison are sayings like <span class="i b">
                            "If I only had...", "If I could have what they had", "If I were
                            where they are"</span> and so on. If you've reached to this stage ‚Äì comparing
                        yourself with others,
                        based on your emotional state ‚Äì congratulations, you're on the path of envy.
                    </p>
                    <h2>The envy loop</h2>
                    <p>
                        Here's a thing I came up with a couple of weeks ago. Insecurity lures people to the toxic
                        comparison stage. Toxic comparison does it‚Äôs best to leads people to either self-pity or hatred
                        ‚Äì the gateway emotions that set one on the path towards envy. Once you step in the envious
                        fields it's a matter of time that you'll hit Stage One again ‚Äì insecurity. You loop.
                        Yet the problem usually grows deeper. The envy spectrum gets wider, covering much more ground
                        than before ‚Äì spreading its plague, growing one's insecurity which inevitable leads to more
                        comparing, then more hate, then more envy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is my theory on why envious people tend to decay morally and emotionally in time. This
                        sort of loop is applicable to other common negative emotions like the superiority complex,
                        aggressiveness and egoism. I‚Äôve struggled a ton with aggressive behaviour, especially in my
                        teen years and the stages are almost identical ‚Äì rather than feeding your insecurities with
                        self-pity, you feed them with anger. While all of the above might sound like a dead end, I
                        found a way out of my situation ‚Äì it required discipline, persistency and self-reflectiveness.
                        Oh, and another thing ‚Äì you cut the bullshit out of your self-talks and get real with yourself.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I was heading home with my newly bought notebook. I had a single goal for the day ‚Äì to sit
                        down, cut the crap and dig deep. I wanted to know what generated all that anger, all that
                        insecurities I was covering up. I knew I had to be patient with myself, applying tremendous
                        efforts on keeping myself mindful to stay focused on the arising emotions once my
                        self-interrogation started.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The mind tends to justify our bad behaviours, masking it as self-love, yet we shouldn‚Äôt fall
                        for that. We all have a moral compass that always knows what's right and we should always aim
                        to listen to it. On top of that, it‚Äôs a nice reality check that judging is still easier than
                        getting judged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I asked myself questions like <span class="i b"> "What are you afraid of?", "What made you this
                            way?", "Why
                            do you approach your fears with X (anger/envy/whatever you'd like to change)", "Have you
                            thought about the people you're hurting?", "What do you have to do to change".
                        </span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I always asked the questions in the second person, a thing I learned throughout my meditation
                        practice since it tricks your brain to be both reflective, yet it doesn't allow your mind to go
                        inwards, risking to slide down on the path of self-pity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The notebook self-intervention was an excellent way to start. I unveiled a ton of truth I was
                        covering up deep in my head, realising my real potential as a person and as a professional.
                        This approach gave me a crystal clear view of both my fears and insecurities. Now all I had to
                        do is to find a way how to deal with them.

                    <h2>Meditaiton</h2>
                    <p>
                        Meditation has been a part of my life for the past 4 years. I can't stress enough how sitting
                        down for 10 minutes could potentially lead you towards a better, content life. Meditation
                        reminded me that kindness, compassion, love and humility are innate feelings, and our biggest
                        enemy is our ego.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through meditation, I learned to put my ego in check, at times I'm even able to catch the
                        initial spark of a negative feeling. And once one's present with the rise of a toxic emotion
                        like this, their mind tends to let go.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beware though, meditation takes years upon years of daily practice to become a powerful tool
                        for the mind. I might have meditated for four years, but I can't even say that I'm past the
                        early beginners' stages. Be patient and curious not about the outcome of your meditations, but
                        the process of it.

                        I started out with Headspace, and this has been my go-to app ever since. Through those guided
                        meditations I was able to change my views on anger and resentment, sadness and pain, acceptance
                        and happiness. I highly suggest if you're a beginner meditator like me, to give Headspace a
                        try. If you're not into apps, Andy Puddicombe has some great books on how to start meditating
                        on your own. You should definitely check them out.

                        Loving-kindness meditation
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The first time I heard that through the repetition of kind wishes/mantras towards a close one,
                        a friend, a person you have a problematic relationship with and then to all beings sounded like
                        absolute nonsense. "Yeah right, like I'll ever want to wish any good to the person I truly
                        dislike," I told myself. Yet the answer to that was simple ‚Äì the more grudges I hold, the more
                        I poison myself.

                        Like the great Marie Curie carrying radioactive plutonium and radium in her pockets unknowingly
                        destroying her health, I bore grudges and hatred towards so many people equally destroying
                        mine. Applying loving-kindness to people you currently apply resentment, envy or
                        name-your-negative-emotion-here is both a victory over your ego, and it's a victory over your
                        self-destructive emotions. Loving your "enemies" might sound counter-intuitive at first, but
                        it's the logical path one should follow. Why destroy your health, holding grudges or being
                        envious towards others, while you could apply all that energy improving your life.

                        Loving-kindness works. And it works wonders. Through this practice, I improved my relationship
                        with my father, some friends and some "rivals". It gave me the ability to swallow up my overly
                        inflated ego and to discover many positives in the people I disliked. It teaches me to let go
                        of the need to compare and to prove to myself that I'm better than others.

                        Applying daily kindness thought me that no matter the differences, we're practically all the
                        same. It's a matter of choice and practice to reach this perception. But like all good things,
                        loving-kindness takes time, and it requires daily discipline.

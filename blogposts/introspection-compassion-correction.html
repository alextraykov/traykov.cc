                        <p class="pb4 lh-copy b">The The Reflective Growth Triad is a mental toolset that I've used in my path of Self-discovery.</p>
                        <ul class="lh-copy">
                            <li class="pb2">Introspection is what allows me to reflect on my thoughts and behaviours. It's what allows me to study my feelings, attitudes, thoughts and models of thinking.</li>
                            <li class="pb2">Compassion allows for empathy and care in dealing with myself and with others. It's what softens my judgmental nature. It's what converts self-hate to elf-acceptance</li>
                            <li class="pb2">Correction is the action step where I combine the insights gained from my self-reflection/ introspection and the understanding from my compassion
                                to make the changes needed towards the better.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p class="lh-copy pb4">It sounds great on paper, but in reality I can conclude one thing - following this triad is simple, but not easy. Through test and trail, I've discovered that the triad cannot function if one of the key components are missing.

                        For years I've applied it in a very dysfunctional way, and even now, I often catch myself not following through at times. Here are the three main examples on how one missing component leads to lack of progress.</p>

                        <h2 class="pb3 f2"> 1. Introspection and Compassion without Correction</h2>
                        <h3 class="pb2 f3">What is it</h3>
                        <p class="lh-copy pb4">Introspection allows one to reflect thoughts and behaviours. Compassion allows one to reflect from an empathetic and kind viewpoint.</p>
                        <h3 class="pb2 f3">What's missing</h3>
                        <p class="lh-copy pb4">Correction is the action step where one applies insights gained from introspection and the empathic understanding from compassion to make a positive, lasting change.</p>
                        <h3 class="pb2 f3">Result of absence</h3>
                        <p class="lh-copy pb4">With the absence of correction, there can't be tangible improvement or change. While one could self-reflect on their faults and empathise with oneself and others, without the implementation of corrective action, there is no ground for practical progress in any domain. The stagnation that often occurs when we face lack of progress can lead to a cycle of always-unmet goals, constant dissatisfaction, which can further erode confidence and self-efficacy. Applying this long enough, the lack of correction can result in innate, subconscious behaviors that impede personal growth and the ability to adapt to new challenges or life in general.</p>

                    <h3 class="pb2 f3">What is it</h3>
                    <p class="lh-copy pb4">Introspection helps self-assessment and understanding of one's actions, motivations and thoughts. Correction involves making the necessary changes based on these understandings.</p>
                    <h3 class="pb2 f3">What's missing</h3>
                    <p class="lh-copy pb4">Compassion is what brings the necessary softness and empathy to the complex process of growth (no matter of the domain). It is what's ensuring that the changes are made in a kind, healthy and understanding manner.</p>
                    <h3 class="pb2 f3">Result of absence</h3>
                    <p class="lh-copy pb4">Lack of compassion can make the process of self-improvement a harsh, toxic and potentially dangerous environment for oneself. It often leads to unrealistically critical attitudes toward oneself and others. With time, this develops in low self-esteem, strained relationships, inferiority complex, anxiety and depression. Without sufficient self-compassion, people may become less resilient, struggle to recover from setbacks, and find it more challenging to maintain motivation and pursue their goals effectively.</p>

                <h2 class="pb3 f2">3. Compassion and Correction without Introspection</h2>
                <h3 class="pb2 f3">What is it</h3>
                <p class="lh-copy pb4">Compassion is what allows care and kindness in dealing with oneself and others. Correction guides us to the application of changes and improvements.</p>
                <h3 class="pb2 f3">What's missing</h3>
                <p class="lh-copy pb4">Introspection is the deep, often painfully honest personal reflection that tells one why changes are needed to be made and identifies the root causes of our issues.</p>
                <h3 class="pb2 f3">Result of absence</h3>
                <p class="lh-copy pb4">Without introspection, our changes tend to be superficial and misdirected, lacking real depth and understanding. Often, we only scratch the surface of our underlying issues, mistakenly believing we have a deep personal understanding of them. This results in ineffective, shallow solutions that fail to address the core issues, rendering our efforts misguided and generally lacking impact. A life guided by compassion and correction but devoid of introspection can lead to self-delusion. If this cycle persists, it can erode one's overall well-being and hinder genuine connections with others, as relationships may suffer from a lack of authenticity and depth.</p>

            <h2 class="pb3 f2"> Conclusion</h2>
            <!-- Section -->
        <p class="lh-copy pb4">Ultimately, the Reflective Growth Triad is not just a theoretical concept but a living practice that evolves through my daily application and persistence. It makes me face the challenges to remain committed to my growth, even in the face of difficulties. By embracing this triad, I've stepped on the long road of transformation - that's not merely to improve my personal well-being, but to deepen my self-understanding - from witnessing my brightest strengths, to forcing myself to be engulfed by my darkest shadows.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy pb4">The journey of self-discovery is indeed "simple, but not easy" - it forces me to confront and reshape my inner most self - day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute.</p>

        <p class="mb3 hover bl bw2 b--grey pa3 bg-near-white flex">Without self-knowledge man goes astray in his thoughts, is dominated by diverse passions, tyrannized by violent desires, troubled about many and vain things, and leads a disorderly, distracted life, erring in all things, wandering on the way, staggering at every step; ... <br> - St. Nectarios of Aegina</p>

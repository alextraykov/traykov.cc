                    <p> Our phones are cool. At times I try to de-attach and acknowledge the fact that tiny
                        pocket-computer resting on the side of my hip contains just about all the knowledge of humanity
                        kindly stored in different servers, flowing through those massive cables at the bottom of the
                        sea. I’m still using my phone for time wasting, neuron-frying activities. Why is this happening?
                        Why do I prefer to burn a ton of brain power in double-taps, story replies or meme retweets
                        rather than go out for a walk with my spouse, make a healthy meal, read a book or meditate?</p>

                    <p>
                        Well, it’s because most of us got hooked. We feed our brains with dopamine through those likes,
                        followers and retweets. We stuff them with bite-size chunks of the hormone of happiness, slowly
                        converting our brains into lazy, overweight instant-gratification seeking slobs.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This Easter I got sick of that. I got frustrated that I’m wasting my life staring at a screen,
                        consuming the lives of others. I looked at my grandma and grandpa, staring in the blank space,
                        silently hoping that we, as grandparents would engage in a chat with them rather than our phones
                        or
                        laptops. I decided to spend less time on my smart brick. I turned off my notifications, turned
                        my
                        display colour to grey and decided to engage with it mindfully. I had to dedicate some function
                        to
                        this engagement — so I planned to use it for meditation, replying to work-related messages,
                        calls
                        with friends and family and to plant real trees through the Forest app. Oh, and probably
                        continue my
                        Dutch practice.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The first day was easy — I had this rush of motivation. I focused on my meditation practice,
                        read
                        almost a whole book and used my phone only to listen to some music. The second day felt more
                        challenging, thankfully though my read was good so that kept me away from burning calories in
                        apps.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On the third day, something interesting happened. The fear of missing out slowly crept into my
                        brain. I was opening and closing my messaging apps, probably unconsciously hoping for social
                        engagement from one of my buds. Why was I seeking attention? I was surrounded by people I like.
                        Why
                        wasn’t I talking to them? Instead of that, we were scrolling together, consuming a satisfying
                        amount
                        of pointless information, slowly pouring our grey matter with gibberish.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I went through my Instagram messages — on both of my accounts, telling myself that my sister,
                        for
                        example, might have shared something cool. And then the wolf trap snapped.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I caught myself mindlessly scrolling through the grey photos (my display filter was still on) of
                        the
                        people I followed. I took a breath. I closed my eyes. The spark of disappointment was arising. I
                        took another breath and let go. I closed the app, put my phone in my pocket, got up and sat on
                        the
                        terrace which was embraced by the warm spring.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The weather was beautiful — the sun rays felt warm on the skin, the air was so fresh that if you
                        paid attention, you’d feel that it tingles your nostrils. Birds were chirping, and the breeze
                        was
                        swaying the trees, forming a calm waltz-like dance. I felt this arising feeling of gratitude
                        that
                        I’m there. In the moment. Living. Experiencing. I felt like I was in the moment, that even
                        though I
                        was sitting, I was present of that.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, that feeling stayed for a while. I felt the smell of the Easter bread. I heard the
                        beautiful voice of my spouse. It felt like bliss.
